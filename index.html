        <h2>Some of my past projects</h2>
        <br>
        <p>This was my first website it was made using HTML5 SCSS and Javascript (Okotoks Pizza doesn't exist)</p>
        <a href="https://okotoksabpizza.ga/">Okotoks Pizza</a>
        <br>
        <p>This is my latest and my final project for school.
            It is a todo list with an animated timer
            as well as a sign up and login function
            meaning it also has a backend too.
            The project was built using VueX, Python, SQL and MariaDB.
